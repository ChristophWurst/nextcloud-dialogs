Nextcloud dialog helpers

## Installation

```
npm i -S @nextcloud/dialogs
```

### Version compatibility
Since version 4.2 this package provides a Vue.js based file picker, so this package depends on `@nextcloud/vue`. So to not introduce style collisions version 4 of this library is only compatible with `@nextcloud/vue` version 7 (used by Nextcloud version 25, 26 and 27).

For `nextcloud/vue` version 8 (Nextcloud 28+) see version 5 of this package.

## Usage

### General
The styles for the components (Toasts and FilePicker) are provided in the `style.css` file.
So make sure that the  `@nextcloud/dialogs/style.css` file is included in your app to make sure that the toasts or FilePicker have a proper styling applied.

```js
import '@nextcloud/dialogs/style.css'
```

### Toasts

```js
import { showMessage, showInfo, showSuccess, showWarning, showError } from '@nextcloud/dialogs'
import '@nextcloud/dialogs/style.css'
```

If you using `@nextcloud/dialogs >= 4.0` you don't need any svg or scss loader in you projects anymore.

There are different toast styles available, that are exposed in separate functions:

```
showMessage('Message without a specific styling')
showInfo('Information')
showSuccess('Success')
showWarning('Warning')
showError('Error')
```

There are several options that can be passed in as a second parameter, like the timeout of a toast:

```
showError('This is an error shown without a timeout', { timeout: -1 })
```

A full list of available options can be found in the [documentation](https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-dialogs/).

### FilePicker
There are two ways to spawn a FilePicker provided by the library:

#### Use the FilePickerBuilder
This way you do not need to use Vue, but can programatically spawn a FilePicker.

```js
import { getFilePickerBuilder } from '@nextcloud/dialogs'
const filepicker = getFilePickerBuilder('Pick plain text files')
    .addMimeTypeFilter('text/plain')
    .addButton({
        label: 'Pick',
        callback: (nodes) => console.log('Picked', nodes),
    })
    .build()

// You get the file nodes by the button callback, but also the pick yields the paths of the picked files
const paths = await filepicker.pick()
```

#### Use the Vue component directly
```vue
<template>
  <FilePicker name="Pick some files" :buttons="buttons" />
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
  import {
    FilePickerVue as FilePicker,
    type IFilePickerButton,
  } from '@nextcloud/dialogs'
  import type { Node } from '@nextcloud/files'
  import IconShare from 'vue-material-design-icons/Share.vue'

  const buttons: IFilePickerButton[] = [
    {
      label: 'Pick',
      callback: (nodes: Node[]) => console.log('Picked', nodes),
      type: 'primary'
    },
    {
      label: 'Share',
      callback: (nodes: Node[]) => console.log('Share picked files', nodes),
      type: 'secondary',
      icon: IconShare,
    }
  ]
</script>
```
